This is an fork of Boomerang Project's Aero GTK3/Cinnamon Theme

## Linux Mint Aero Cinnamon
An theme made and reccomended to work with Mint-X (or the old theme of Mint), it has the Aero-esque feel of Windows Aero, but to be more used with the Mint's branding color, or as we call it, the Mint Leaf

## Better Recommendation
My personal reccomendation is using it with Tango2 icons and Mint-X GTK theme
